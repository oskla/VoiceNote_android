# VoiceNote Android

***



This application was made for Android-phones, built in *Kotlin* with *Jetpack Compose*, *Room*, *Koin*, *Material3*, *Lottie*, *Coroutines*, *Navigation*, *Git*, *Figma.*

Except for some Material icons, everything is made by me, including the design.

The purpose of the app is to have a combined app for Voice memos AND regular notes. The thought is to have the possibility to attach recordings to a specific note.

This is a work in progress!
